# Basic project context
This is a project by Martin Borg√©n to implement a sodoku solver. 

The purpose is to practice following proper practice w.r.t. organization
and discipline when setting up a project. 

The goal is to have a project suitable for a portfolio, with clear structure, 
commit messages, git usage, etc. to show my ability to develop software 
in a professional setting. 

The first part is to make a Sodoku -class that provides useful functionality for 
a sodoku solving program. Secondly, a sodoku solving algorithm is implemented, 
at time of writing a brute-force depth-first search because of its simplicity.

A solver is purposefully not included in the sodoku class, as typicall thats the 
problem for the user to solve :)
