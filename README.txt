This is a project by Martin Borg√©n to implement a sodoku solver. 

The purpose is to practice following proper practice w.r.t. organization
and discipline when setting up a project. 

The goal is to have a project suitable for a portfolio, with clear structure, 
commit messages, git usage, etc. to show my ability to develop software 
in a professional setting.
